      <div class="titles">Sudoku Solving XY Plotter</div>
      <p>The Sudoku Solving XY Plotter was built in response to an cumulative project my 'Introduction to Methods of Software Engineering (SE101)' course. The only guidelines that were implemented were the to incorporate the use of an Arduino, program the project in entirely C or C++, and produce something that was super cool. As a result from our many sleepless nights and dedication, our final project recieved a perfect final grade, here is what we made (pictures below). Our project was a Sudoku Solving XY Plotter (CNC machine). A brief overview of the software used in the machine were, taking a picture of a physically printed sudoku board, read the image, input the values in our self-made sudoku algorithm, and then physically draw the result with the CNC machine. The technologies used to accomplish this were with OpenCV, a computer vision software, Tesseract, which gave values for each corresponding number and storing them in a text file, C++, in which coded our own sudoku solving algorithm which used both iteration, and backtracking to solve, and then a G-Code interpreter to write the values. Finally, a brief description of the construction timeline included scavenge for 3d printer parts - linear bearings, linear shafts, and pulleys - and electrical components - Arduino, CNC shield, Nema 17 stepper motors, drivers, and a power supply. Then 3d printing a basic design to string all our components together, <a href="http://3dmake.club/articles/drawing-machine/1-bill-of-materials.html"> found here</a>. After constructing the machine, wiring everything, and tinkering with the Arduino GRBL code, the project was finally complete. All in all, this project has been the most complicated I have attempted in terms of technical skills in both hardware and software. The components of the project I most enjoyed were coordinating with two other software engineers, learning all the required technical skills, and creating something super cool!
