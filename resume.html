          <h3>Sudoku Solving XY Plotter</h3>
          <h4>Introduction to Methods of Software Engineering</h4>
          <li>Coded a sudoku solving algorithm in C that first partially solved a sudoku board without any “guesses” iteratively and then a backtracking recursive in order to use a smaller stack and optimize time complexity.</li>
          <li>Using OpenCV and a Tesseract API, our team was able to read the digits of a physical sudoku board taken from a secondary computer camera.</li>
          <li>Constructed an XY plotter to write the solution of the sudoku board onto any physical surface. This required first assembling the plotter using 3d printer parts such as linear bearings, linear shafts, and idler pulleys, and then using an Arduino with a CNC shield to control three unipolar stepper motors – Nema 17s and 28BYJ – to control writing.</li>
          <h3>UWRT Zero Competition</h3>
          <h4>University of Waterloo Robotics Team</h4>
          <li>In a team of four engineers consisting of mechanical, electrical and software leaders, we collectively constructed a ‘Line Following Music Player’ of our own design that was able to drive straight with course correction, read greyscale and output a corresponding sound. Our build placed fourth in a competition hosted by the University of Waterloo’s Robotics Team.</li>
          <li>Using the hardware platform created by the electrical and mechanical engineers, I was able to use timers and interrupts on the Arduino IDE to continuously convert analog signals into meaning outputted musical notes.</li>
          <li>Managed and lead the software team – consisting of two software engineers – to keep deadlines, provide expertise, and offer guidance which resulted in the completion of the project in time for the competition date.</li>

          <h3>Program Assistant</h3>
          <h4>Kumon Unionville, ON, 2013 - 2017</h4>
          <li>Administered training and provided guidance to new program assistants, who were then able to complete assigned tasks with ease within only two sessions of training.</li>
          <li>Thoroughly teach complex mathematical concepts to high school students in areas of trigonometry, differential and integral calculus, and logarithms, who then succeeded in completing Kumon administered assessments</li>
          <li>Effectively communicated with franchise owner on a day-to-day basis to ensure efficient workflow between individual assistants and students, which resulted in the entire team to clearly understand each day’s grading goals and priorities</li>
          <h3>Lifeguard and Swim Instructor</h3>
          <h4>City of Markham, Markham, ON, 2015 - 2017</h4>
          <li>Clearly communicated with colleagues to ensure that emergency aquatic situations were resolved quickly and orderly.</li>
          <li>Planned and organized classes through customized lesson plans and long-term core plans to ensure progressive learning.</li>
          <li id="end">Provided direct instruction and evaluation to program participants to create an enjoyable learning environment for students from a range of mental capacities, age, and background.</li>
